# Personal
I live in Curitiba/PR Brazil. I went to Universidade Positivo from 2011-3 where I got an associate degree in Technology analysis and System development and soon after I got a Post-graduated (lato-sensu) in Software Engineering from 2014-2.
Currently, I work at FAEP developing new PHP's systems and sometimes I fix some bugs in old systems developed in Delphi 7.
Well, I enjoy my free time playing violin and video game. I enjoy some hours playing when I need get some rest or relax after a tired day. On my vacation I really like go abroad with my girlfriend to know new places, cultures, try differents foods and I dream in know all the world one day.

# Professional/Skills
  I have a great interest in understand how to design software systems and improve the programming style. I’m always thinking “My code should tell a little story”.
My main skills are using PHP, SQL, Databases (Firebird and MySQL), Javascript and I do have knowledge of MongoDB (NoSQL). I dislike clone codes and frameworks - I have preference by server-side and don’t spend much time studying about front-end development. I only use client-side frameworks like Bootstrap and AngularJS - AngularJS is Amazing!. 
I really enjoy developing my own code - I know sometimes I "Reinventing the wheel". But I think that is great because because I can learn a lot of things and really understand how all the flow works.
My favorite O.S are all Linux distros based on Debian as Ubuntu, Mint, Kubuntu. To practice and improve some of new skills in server administration I have my own cloud hosted in Digital Ocean, that is great because I know how the environment works, how to configure it and if the infra guys have any trouble I can help.
